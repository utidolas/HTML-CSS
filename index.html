        <h3>Daniela</h3>
        <p>This has been one of the most authentic and fun Airbnb experiences I've had after travelling 10+ yrs! The eco-dome dome is a MUST to any "to do list" !</p>

        <h3>Sophia</h3>
        <p>Our stay with Vero & Mau was very nice, they were very communicative about how to locate and enter the place. The driveway and parking lot were quite tight, so be careful, especially if you're driving a big vehicle! Otherwise everything was easy to access, the room itself was very nice and the views of the rainforest were very pretty!</p>
